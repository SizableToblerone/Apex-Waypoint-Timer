# Waypoint Timer

#### A graphic circular timer, currently specifically for *Apex Legends*.
##### Eventually to be converted to a more general version.

While this window is open, the
    timer is scanning your screen
    for match start/end triggers.
    Closing this window exits
    the application. Minimizing
    this window will not interfere
    with the program's function. 
    
    The application does not store
    nor share any data it scans,
    and only scans 24,950 specific
    pixels of your 2,073,600 pixel
    resolution. 
    If your resolution is not 
    1920x1080p, this program is 
    unlikely to function. You will
    then need to use the manual
    buttons at the top of this 
    window, in lieu of the intended
    auto-start function. Support for
    other resolutions will be included 
    in future versions
